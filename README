DESCRIPTION
    Business::Colissimo helps you to produce shipping labels for the
    following ColiPoste services:

    Access France
            $colissimo = Business::Colissimo->new(mode => 'access_f');

    Expert France
            $colissimo = Business::Colissimo->new(mode => 'expert_f');

    Expert Outre Mer
            $colissimo = Business::Colissimo->new(mode => 'expert_om');

    Expert International
            KPG countries:

            $colissimo = Business::Colissimo->new(mode => 'expert_i_kpg');

            Countries outside of KPG:

            $colissimo = Business::Colissimo->new(mode => 'expert_i');

METHODS
  new
        $colissimo = Business::Colissimo->new(mode => 'access_f',
             customer_number => '900001',
             parcel_number => '2052475203',
             postal_code => '72240',
             weight => 250);

        $colissimo = Business::Colissimo->new(mode => 'expert_f',
             customer_number => '900001',
             parcel_number => '2052475203',
             postal_code => '72240',
             weight => 250,
             cod => 1,
             level => '01');

  barcode
    Produces the tracking barcode:

        $colissimo->barcode('tracking');

    Same with proper spacing for the shipping label:

        $colissimo->barcode('tracking', spacing => 1);

    Produces the sorting barcode:

        $colissimo->barcode('sorting');

    Same with proper spacing for the shipping label:

        $colissimo->barcode('sorting', spacing => 1);

  barcode_image
    Produces PNG image for tracking barcode:

        $colissimo->barcode_image('tracking');

    Produces PNG image for sorting barcode:

        $colissimo->barcode_image('sorting');

    Produces PNG image for arbitrary barcode:

        $colissimo->barcode_image('8L20524752032');

    The scale of the image can be changed for each barcode individually:

        $colissimo->barcode_image('8L20524752032', scale => 2);

    The default scale is set to 1, because that produces images with the
    right number of pixels to include them into PDF with PDF::API2, which
    uses 72dpi resolution for images unless you specify width and height
    explicitly (see PDF::API2::Content).

    The formula for calculating width in mm for a 72dpi resolution is as
    follows:

        (1px * 25.4) / 72dpi

    This fits into Colissimo's requirement for the basic module (narrowest
    element of the bar code) of 0.33 to 0.375 mm.
